        <p>Does your accelerator need training workshops for entrepreneurs?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We provide interactive workshops from 2 hours to all day, or,</li>
          <li>2 to 10-day programs, depending on your needs and budget.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’ve delivered workshops around the world for 1000’s of entrepreneurs. Our workshops are skills based. We
          demonstrate a point – then have the attendees work on their solution and present the result.</p>

        <p> We know from experience that many entrepreneurs will avoid standing up and participating. We provide 1-on-1
          coaching in presenting and have everyone get up and present several times during the program. The result is a
          clear increase in confidence!</p>
        <p>These workshops are geared for go-to-market activities to gain customers. We stress customer
          focus, build the sales pipeline, use metrics, budgeting and cash management and proper governance to
          achieve results.</p>
        <p>
          The outcome is that the entrepreneurs learn both leadership and presentation skills.</p>
        <p>We prefer to work with startups that already have a product concept and are ready to go-to-market. We
          are experienced in software, hardware, IoT and B2B sales and operations.</p>

              <p>
                Pitching to investors is a “right-of-passage” for entrepreneurs. Raising funds usually takes much more
                time than founders expect. It often takes dozens – even a hundred or more meetings to meet the
                investment goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people think pitching to investors is about following a slide template and learning how to talk in
                front of the room.
              </p>

              <p>But it’s much more than that. </p>
              <p>Make an effective pitching includes the ability to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a vision with personal credibility. </li>
                <li>Understand and speak to the investor mindset. </li>
                <li>Present and discuss your plan in a brief, powerful way like a seasoned executive.</li>
                <li>Use key metrics built upon customer validation, research and go-to-market planning.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge and manage risk; (many founders do everything to discount risk which does not work).</li>
                <li>Demonstrate being “coachable, adaptable and responsible.”</li>
              </ul>

              <strong>Benefits</strong>
              <p>A person trained to make effective presentations will dramatically increase their effectiveness. The
                results include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A huge improvement in confidence and presentation skills,</li>
                <li>Less time hunting funds, </li>
                <li>Potentially higher valuation and better terms, and,</li>
                <li>Better relations and expectations with investors.</li>
              </ul>

              <strong>Objectives</strong>
              <p>When you take the full program the result is a complete pitch deck and the ability to present an
                effective story with and without slides. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make an effective pitch deck and make a compelling presentation to investors.</li>
                <li>Use body language and clear speaking to establish credibility and trust.</li>
                <li>Realize the importance of credibility and being realistic while building a vision for the future.</li>
                <li>Understand and speak to the investors point of view. </li>

                <li>Tell the story so that investors will clearly understand your value proposition and potential so
                  they may make an investment decision. </li>
                <li>Present your company in an elevator pitch, (30-60 seconds), and in 2 to 4 minutes with and without
                  using slides. </li>
                <li>Show confidence in verbal presentation. Cover the key business metrics. Make clear, simple
                  explanations. </li>
                <li>Understand the investors point of view. </li>
                <li>Have a completed pitch deck for presentation on projectors. Add brief content to a second version
                  for mailing out.</li>
                <li>Optional: have a 1-page executive overview completed.</li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Duration</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>2 hours or half day, and</li>
                <li>1 to 10-day programs, depending on your needs and budget.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Normally 4 days are needed to get to a basic proficiency level for college grads with a few years work
                experience and a working prototype. Each day after that allows us to increase skills with the
                attendees.</p>
              <p>Partial day workshops focus on skills and making effective slides.</p>
              <p>Multiday workshops focus on building the foundation up to presentation and useful forecasts and
                go-to-market plans.</p>
              <p>Note: We know from experience that a newer team with a working product needs at least four days to get
                a solid plan and presentation put together. We will provide a pre-workshop either via a video, or live
                presentation 1 to 2 weeks before the event to help the startups to prepare.</p>
